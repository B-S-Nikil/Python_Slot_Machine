Title: Python Slot Machine Game

Introduction:
This is a Python-based slot machine game project that simulates a classic slot machine in a command-line interface. The program is written in Python 3 and uses the 'random' library to generate the results of the slot machine.

Features:
The slot machine game consists of three reels and one payline. The player starts with a certain amount of credits and can bet a certain number of credits on each spin. The reels then spin, and the player wins or loses based on the combination of symbols that appear on the payline. 

Installation:
To run the game, the player needs to have Python 3 installed on their computer. They can then download the source code from the GitHub repository and run the game from the command line. There are no additional dependencies required.

Usage:
To start the game, the player runs the 'main.py' file from the command line. The game will prompt the player to enter the number of credits they want to start with and the amount they want to bet on each spin. The player can then start playing the game and continue playing until they run out of credits or decide to quit.
